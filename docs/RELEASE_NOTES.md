# Calendar Card Pro v3.0.0

## Breaking Changes

The following parameters have been removed or renamed in v3.0.0:

- `max_events_to_show` (both global and entity-level) has been removed - use `compact_events_to_show` instead
- `vertical_line_color` has been renamed to `accent_color` to better reflect its purpose as it's used for both vertical lines and event backgrounds
- `horizontal_line_width` has been removed - use `day_separator_width` instead
- `horizontal_line_color` has been removed - use `day_separator_color` instead

If you were still using any of these parameters in your configuration, please update to the new parameter names.

## 🎉 New Features

### 🌦️ Weather Integration

Calendar Card Pro now supports displaying weather forecasts directly alongside your calendar events! This powerful new integration allows you to see the expected weather conditions for each day or for specific events.

- **Dual Display Positions**: Show weather in the date column, event column, or both
- **Customizable Information**: Choose what weather data to display independently for each position
- **Per-Position Styling**: Control the appearance and content of weather data independently in each position
- **Automatic Forecast Matching**: Weather data automatically matches the correct day or event time
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Uses your existing weather entities and requires no additional setup

#### Configuration Example

# Calendar Card Pro v2.4.5

**Consistent calendar display in all scenarios.** This release fixes an important bug affecting the display of empty days when an API call returns no events.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Completely Consistent Empty Days Display

- **Unified Empty Days Logic** - Removed separate rendering paths for different empty day scenarios, ensuring consistent behavior in all cases
- **Fixed Show Empty Days Setting** - Corrected the handling of `show_empty_days: true` when the calendar API returns zero events

```yaml
card_mod:
  style: |
    div.event-content {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-areas: 
        "title time"
        "location location";
      grid-template-columns: 1fr auto;
      column-gap: 10px;
      row-gap: 0px;
    }

    div.summary {
      grid-area: title;
      overflow: hidden;
      text-overflow: ellipsis;
    }

    div.time {
      grid-area: time;
      white-space: nowrap;
    }

    div.location {
      grid-area: location;
      white-space: normal;
      overflow: hidden;
      text-overflow: ellipsis;
    }

    div.time-location {
      display: contents;
    }
```

**Edge case handling and visual refinement.** This update addresses two specific user-reported issues to ensure your calendar card displays correctly in all scenarios.

→→→ All bug fixes are fully compatible with existing configurations, requiring no changes to your cards. ←←←

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Empty Day Display Issue

Resolved a bug where days with no events were being skipped if:

Enhanced the scrollbar handling to:

- Show vertical scrollbars only when hovering and content exceeds the container height
- Never show horizontal scrollbars regardless of content width
- Maintain consistent behavior across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Related Issues

This release addresses the following user-reported issues:

# Calendar Card Pro v2.2.0

**Calendar filtering and customization, redefined.** This release focuses on giving you precise control over which events appear on your dashboard and how they're displayed, with powerful filtering capabilities and enhanced visual options.

→→→ Please see the [🆕 What's New](#2️⃣-whats-new) section in the README for an overview of v2.2 features with links to their detailed documentation. ←←←

## 🎉 New Features

### Advanced Event Filtering

Calendar Card Pro now provides powerful filtering capabilities with regex-based `blocklist` and `allowlist` patterns for each calendar entity:

```yaml
# Exclude specific events by pattern:
entities:
  - entity: calendar.work
    blocklist: "Private|Conference" # Hide private meetings and conferences

# Only show specific events:
entities:
  - entity: calendar.family
    allowlist: "Birthday|Anniversary" # Only show birthdays and anniversaries
```

- **Per-Entity Filtering** - Each calendar can have its own filter rules
- **Regular Expression Support** - Use pattern matching for flexible event filtering
- **Precise Control** - Include or exclude events based on title text patterns
- **Priority System** - When both filters are specified, allowlist takes precedence

### Filter Duplicate Events

Automatically detect and remove redundant events that appear in multiple calendars:

```yaml
entities:
  - calendar.personal # Events from this calendar are prioritized
  - calendar.family # Duplicates from this calendar will be hidden
filter_duplicates: true
```

- **Smart Prioritization** - When duplicates are found, keeps events from calendars listed first
- **Complete Matching** - Compares event title, times, and location for accurate detection
- **Better Organization** - Creates a cleaner view when subscribing to multiple calendars with overlapping events

### Enhanced Calendar Labels

Calendar labels now support multiple formats for better visual customization:

```yaml
entities:
  - entity: calendar.work
    label: '💻' # Original emoji style
  - entity: calendar.family
    label: 'mdi:account-group' # Material Design Icon
  - entity: calendar.vacation
    label: '/local/icons/beach.png' # Custom image
```

- **Material Design Icons** - Use `mdi:icon-name` to display any Material Design icon
- **Custom Images** - Reference images from your `/local/` directory
- **Emoji & Text** - Original label functionality still supported
- **Automatic Format Detection** - The card detects and renders the appropriate format

### Smart Country Filtering

Enhanced control over country names in location displays with three operating modes:

```yaml
# Option 1: Specify exactly which countries to remove
remove_location_country: "USA|United States|Canada"

# Option 2: Use built-in country detection (previous behavior)
remove_location_country: true

# Option 3: Keep all country information (new default)
remove_location_country: false
```

- **Extended Parameter** - Now accepts custom country name patterns in addition to boolean values
- **Backward Compatible** - Still supports the previous `true`/`false` options
- **Regular Expression Support** - Match multiple country variations with one pattern
- **Enhanced Flexibility** - Keep international locations intact while simplifying domestic addresses
- **⚠ Default Changed** - Now defaults to `false` for more predictable global behavior

### Customizable Empty Day Styling

Control how days without events appear in your calendar:

```yaml
empty_day_color: '#ff5722' # Use custom color
```

- **Custom Text Color** - Set the perfect color for "No events" messages
- **Theme Integration** - Works with Home Assistant theme variables
- **Enhanced Accessibility** - Better control over contrast ratios

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Multi-Day Event Time Display** - Multi-day events now correctly show start time when viewing before or on the event's start date
- **Improved Country Detection** - Enhanced location parsing for more reliable country name removal

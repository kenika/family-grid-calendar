# Calendar Card Pro v3.1.0

**Enhanced internationalization and improved customization.** This release significantly expands language support for the visual configuration editor while adding powerful new customization options and fixing important display issues.

## üéâ New Features

### üåê Expanded Editor Language Support

Calendar Card Pro's visual configuration editor now supports three additional languages, making configuration accessible to even more users:

- **Norwegian Bokm√•l Editor Translation** - Complete translation for the visual configuration editor interface (Thanks @mathiasbk, #235)
- **German Editor Translation** - Complete translation for the visual configuration editor interface (Thanks @NetSecond, #237)
- **Swedish Editor Translation** - Complete translation for the visual configuration editor interface (Thanks @JonasHedberg, #238)

The visual editor now supports 5 languages total: English, Slovak, Norwegian, German, and Swedish.

### üÜï New Language Addition

- **Bulgarian Language Support** - Added complete Bulgarian translation for the calendar card interface, bringing the total number of supported languages to **30**! (Thanks @kyutov, #246)

### üé® Enhanced Styling Capabilities

- **Tomorrow CSS Class** - Added new HTML `tomorrow` CSS class to tomorrow's events, enabling users to use card-mod to apply specific styling to tomorrow's events that's distinct from other future events. See the ReadMe for an example. (Thanks @Squazel, #249)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Weather Display Improvements

- **Zero Temperature Display Fix** - Fixed an issue where minimum temperature values of exactly 0¬∞ would not be displayed in the date column when `show_low_temp: true` was configured. The condition now properly handles zero values by checking for `undefined` instead of using truthy evaluation. (Thanks @DaveOzzie, #252)

### Layout and Container Issues

- **Grid Container Overflow Fix** - Resolved an issue where the calendar card would exceed its container boundaries and overlay other sections when `grid_options.rows` was configured. The card now properly respects container boundaries in all grid configurations. (Thanks @Deltids, #233)

# Calendar Card Pro v2.3.0

**Time-aware and visually enhanced.** This release brings dynamic countdown displays, weekend styling, and flexible date ranges that adapt to your needs, making Calendar Card Pro more informative and visually distinct than ever before.

## üéâ New Features

### Countdown Display

Show how much time remains until an event starts with the new `show_countdown` option:

```yaml
# Enable countdown display for upcoming events
show_countdown: true
```

- **Automatic Time Units** - Shows days remaining for future events, hours for same-day events
- **Multi-Language Support** - Countdown text automatically uses your configured language
- **Subtle Design** - Unobtrusive display that complements the existing time information
- **Enhanced Awareness** - Quickly see which events are coming up soon

### Weekend Day Styling

Make weekend days visually distinct with dedicated color options:

```yaml
# Style weekend days differently
weekend_weekday_color: '#E67C73' # Color for Sat/Sun weekday names
weekend_day_color: '#E67C73' # Color for weekend day numbers
weekend_month_color: '#E67C73' # Color for month names on weekends
```

- **Enhanced Visual Organization** - Weekend days stand out from weekdays
- **Complete Control** - Separately style weekday names, day numbers, and month names
- **Theme Integration** - Works with Home Assistant theme variables and custom colors
- **Improved Readability** - Easier to distinguish between work days and weekend days

### Dynamic Start Date with Relative Offsets

Define "floating" start dates relative to the current day:

```yaml
# Start date examples:
start_date: "today+7"  # Always show events starting 7 days from today
start_date: "+3"       # Shorthand for today+3
start_date: "today-2"  # Show events starting from 2 days ago
start_date: "-1"       # Shorthand for today-1 (yesterday)
```

- **Automatic Adjustment** - Date range automatically updates as days pass
- **Shorthand Notation** - Simplified syntax with + and - operators
- **Fixed or Dynamic** - Use absolute dates for fixed ranges or relative offsets for floating windows
- **Flexible Planning** - Perfect for showing "next two weeks" or "current week plus 3 days" views

### Automatic Hyphenation

Long words (especially compound words in languages like German) now wrap more elegantly with automatic hyphenation.

### Enhanced Cache Management

Improved caching mechanism by adding version-aware caching to automatically invalidate incompatible cache data after updates.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed All-Day Event Sorting** - All-day events are now properly sorted by calendar entity order first, then alphabetically
- **Improved Multi-Day Event Handling** - Multi-day events that begin before a custom start date now display consistently
- **Cache Invalidation After Updates** - Prevents blank cards after HACS updates by adding version numbers to cache keys

## üéâ New Features

### Advanced Event Filtering

Calendar Card Pro now provides powerful filtering capabilities with regex-based `blocklist` and `allowlist` patterns for each calendar entity:

```yaml
# Exclude specific events by pattern:
entities:
  - entity: calendar.work
    blocklist: "Private|Conference" # Hide private meetings and conferences

# Only show specific events:
entities:
  - entity: calendar.family
    allowlist: "Birthday|Anniversary" # Only show birthdays and anniversaries
```

- **Per-Entity Filtering** - Each calendar can have its own filter rules
- **Regular Expression Support** - Use pattern matching for flexible event filtering
- **Precise Control** - Include or exclude events based on title text patterns
- **Priority System** - When both filters are specified, allowlist takes precedence

### Filter Duplicate Events

Automatically detect and remove redundant events that appear in multiple calendars:

```yaml
entities:
  - calendar.personal # Events from this calendar are prioritized
  - calendar.family # Duplicates from this calendar will be hidden
filter_duplicates: true
```

- **Smart Prioritization** - When duplicates are found, keeps events from calendars listed first
- **Complete Matching** - Compares event title, times, and location for accurate detection
- **Better Organization** - Creates a cleaner view when subscribing to multiple calendars with overlapping events

### Enhanced Calendar Labels

Calendar labels now support multiple formats for better visual customization:

```yaml
entities:
  - entity: calendar.work
    label: 'üíª' # Original emoji style
  - entity: calendar.family
    label: 'mdi:account-group' # Material Design Icon
  - entity: calendar.vacation
    label: '/local/icons/beach.png' # Custom image
```

- **Material Design Icons** - Use `mdi:icon-name` to display any Material Design icon
- **Custom Images** - Reference images from your `/local/` directory
- **Emoji & Text** - Original label functionality still supported
- **Automatic Format Detection** - The card detects and renders the appropriate format

### Smart Country Filtering

Enhanced control over country names in location displays with three operating modes:

```yaml
# Option 1: Specify exactly which countries to remove
remove_location_country: "USA|United States|Canada"

# Option 2: Use built-in country detection (previous behavior)
remove_location_country: true

# Option 3: Keep all country information (new default)
remove_location_country: false
```

- **Extended Parameter** - Now accepts custom country name patterns in addition to boolean values
- **Backward Compatible** - Still supports the previous `true`/`false` options
- **Regular Expression Support** - Match multiple country variations with one pattern
- **Enhanced Flexibility** - Keep international locations intact while simplifying domestic addresses
- **‚ö† Default Changed** - Now defaults to `false` for more predictable global behavior

### Customizable Empty Day Styling

Control how days without events appear in your calendar:

```yaml
empty_day_color: '#ff5722' # Use custom color
```

- **Custom Text Color** - Set the perfect color for "No events" messages
- **Theme Integration** - Works with Home Assistant theme variables
- **Enhanced Accessibility** - Better control over contrast ratios

## üêõ Bug Fixes
